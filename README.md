PowerBI dashboard for bicycle sales data analysis.

This was built based on a tutorial to analyse the sales data of 2021 and 2022 and provide recommendations for price changes. 

Comments:
Personally followed this tutorial as it was real business usecase which incorporates good recommendations.
Learnings:
Connecting data from a DB server by querying data. It also provided some good recommendations which would add value to a business.
